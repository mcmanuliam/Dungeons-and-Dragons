**Name**: Bertram Crowl  
**Race**: Gnome  
**Gender**: Male  
**Age**: Appears to be in his late 50s, though his tired, hollow gaze makes him seem older  
**Role**: Innkeeper of the **Mirth Inn**  
**Location**: Mirth Inn, at the edge of the village square
## Appearance

- **Height**: 5'9"
- **Build**: Slightly stooped, with broad shoulders and a wiry frame, hinting at a stronger past now faded with time
- **Hair**: Sparse, thin black hair, graying at the temples, often disheveled and damp as if from constant perspiration
- **Eyes**: Dark brown, with a glazed, sunken look as if lost in thoughts or memories he’d rather forget
- **Clothing**: Wears a faded, dark brown waistcoat over a white shirt that’s perpetually stained and slightly worn. A small silver ring glints on his left hand, bearing an unusual engraved pattern—perhaps a family heirloom
- **Distinguishing Features**: His fingernails are surprisingly well-kept, almost meticulously clean, in contrast to his otherwise unkempt appearance. A long scar runs across his left cheek, a reminder of a past altercation he never discusses.

## Personality

- **Wary & Quiet**: Bertram is a man of few words. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice that carries a faint tremor, and he often seems distracted, as if he’s listening to something others can’t hear. When he does engage, his responses are short and to the point.
- **Observant & Mistrustful**: He watches guests with a careful, suspicious eye. His gaze often lingers a moment too long, giving patrons the uncomfortable sense that he knows things about them they haven’t said.
- **Resigned & Resentful**: Beneath his reserved nature lies a subtle bitterness, a quiet anger held just below the surface. His tone occasionally carries a resigned edge, especially when he speaks of Mirthvale and its people, hinting at grievances he holds close to his chest.

## History

Bertram wasn’t always the innkeeper of Mirthvale. Rumor has it he once worked as a guard in a far-off town, but something happened—a violent incident that left him scarred and exiled from his former life. His connection to Lady Tova is unclear, but some say she offered him the inn as a kind of “atonement” for something he did, a debt he repays with quiet servitude.

For all his coldness, he seems to take pride in his role at the Mirth Inn, keeping meticulous records of visitors and providing a strange hospitality that’s efficient but devoid of warmth. Some villagers whisper that he’s been “bound” to the inn by Lady Tova and that his presence is as much for surveillance as it is for service.

Despite his stern demeanor, a few regulars say they’ve seen him whispering to himself in the dead of night, speaking to shadows as if they’re old friends. There are hints of an old, buried sadness in his demeanor, though he never speaks of it. The inn itself is unnervingly quiet under his watch, as if Bertram imposes a curfew on noise and life within its walls.
