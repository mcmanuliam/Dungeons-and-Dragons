## History

Captain Finnwick Bramblefoot has served Mirthvale for as long as anyone can remember. A former scout with a mysterious past, he arrived in the village decades ago, drawn by its seclusion and its enigmatic leader, Lady Tova. Since then, he has risen to become her trusted second-in-command and a core member of the Village Council. Finn is known to have a web of connections with nearby communities, though few know exactly how far his network of contacts reaches.

Though he presents himself as the village’s jovial protector, some say Finn is Lady Tova’s eyes and ears in Mirthvale, listening for any hint of discontent or secrets that might threaten the village’s delicate balance. His loyalty to Lady Tova is unwavering, and it’s whispered that he is one of the few who understands the true purpose of the Council and the lengths to which they’ll go to keep Mirthvale safe.
