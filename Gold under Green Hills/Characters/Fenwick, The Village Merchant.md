**Name**: Fenwick  
**Race**: Gnome  
**Gender**: Male  
**Age**: Middle-aged (around 50 years old in gnome terms)  
**Role**: Local Merchant  
**Location**: Outside a small, well-kept shop selling various goods, including herbs, potions, and trinkets (Mirthy Merchants)

## Appearance

- **Height**: 3' 2" (short, even for a gnome)
- **Build**: Thin, with a slightly hunched posture, often fidgeting with his hands.
- **Hair**: A mop of untidy, silver-grey hair that falls loosely around his face. His hair appears as though it's never properly styled, giving him a scruffy, disheveled look.
- **Eyes**: Bright green eyes, but they often dart nervously from side to side, avoiding prolonged eye contact.
- **Clothing**: Fenwick wears a patched-up tunic, with a faded brown apron covering it, adorned with pockets filled with small vials and trinkets. His clothing is practical but well-worn, hinting at the life of someone constantly on the move. He’s often seen adjusting his vest or pulling nervously at his sleeves.
- **Distinguishing Features**: His constant fidgeting with small items—coins, keys, or bits of thread—is his most distinguishing feature. His nervous laughter and jittery movements give him a slightly uncomfortable presence, though his attempts to appear friendly and open are clear.

## Personality

- **Nervous & Jittery**: Fenwick is constantly on edge, his hands never still, always moving something or fidgeting with his clothes or tools. He seems perpetually anxious, like he’s afraid of something he can’t control. His nervous demeanor is amplified in tense situations.
- **Eager to Please**: Despite his anxiety, Fenwick is always quick to offer help, especially to strangers. He’s eager to please and is enthusiastic about his shop, but his words are often scattered, revealing his inner unease.
- **Secretive & Avoidant**: When asked about certain topics, especially the missing people of Mirthvale, Fenwick becomes uneasy. He tries to avoid direct confrontation by redirecting conversations to unrelated subjects like flowers or the weather.
- **Well-Intentioned but Easily Frightened**: Fenwick is not malicious, but his fear of upsetting others or getting caught up in something dangerous often causes him to say too much or act nervously. He means well, but his overwhelming fear makes him an unreliable source of information.

## History

Fenwick is a longtime resident of Mirthvale, though not much is known about his past. He is the owner of a small shop that sells herbs, potions, and a variety of trinkets. Despite being a merchant, Fenwick is more of a collector of oddities than a true trader, acquiring strange items in exchange for his goods.

He comes from a long line of herbalists and potion-brewers, but he seems to be more interested in the curiosities of life than in the actual practice of potion-making. Fenwick’s shop is often filled with things that don’t quite fit into a typical merchant’s inventory—strange rocks, mysterious bottles, and peculiar trinkets that seem to serve no purpose.

While he’s generally well-liked by the villagers, there’s something a bit off about him. His fidgeting and scattered mannerisms suggest he is hiding something, though no one has been able to pin down what. Fenwick’s past is a subject he avoids at all costs, and his reluctance to talk about it only deepens the mystery.
