- **Height**: 2' 6" (very short, even by gnome standards)
- **Build**: Slightly hunched with age, but still surprisingly spry for her years.
- **Hair**: Silver-grey, tightly pulled back into an elegant updo, with a few stray wisps escaping.
- **Eyes**: Piercing blue eyes that seem to miss nothing; their intensity is both unsettling and captivating.
- **Clothing**: Lady Tova wears a long, finely woven cloak made of rich, muted colors—deep blues and purples—embroidered with intricate floral patterns. A gold brooch in the shape of a delicate flower rests near her shoulder, catching the light.
- **Distinguishing Features**: The brooch, while simple, carries an air of importance, and her smile is always warm, albeit a little too measured. There is a sense of controlled power in her presence.

- **Manipulative & Guarded**: Beneath the warmth, however, there is a calculated calmness. She carefully controls what she says, and there is always an undercurrent of authority in her demeanor. She maintains a facade of politeness that is never broken, even in the face of probing questions.
- **Intelligent & Observant**: Tova’s sharp intellect and watchful nature make her a master of reading people. Her piercing gaze seems to look right through people, sensing their true intentions without them realizing it.

## History

Lady Tova has been the unofficial matriarch of Mirthvale for as long as anyone can remember. Though not formally in charge (Mirthvale doesn’t have an official ruler), she holds significant influence within the village. She is a descendant of a long line of gnomes known for their wisdom and their subtle manipulation of events behind the scenes.

It’s whispered that Lady Tova is more than just a figurehead; she is the keeper of Mirthvale’s secrets. She knows things that others do not—secrets about the village’s eerie peace, the strange happenings around the missing persons, and perhaps even darker truths about the village’s past. However, she keeps these secrets locked away, only revealing them when necessary, often with careful calculations to maintain control.

Some say she’s been alive longer than anyone can recall, her longevity being tied to some arcane secret, though no one dares to ask directly. She is seen as a protector of the village, though her protection often feels more like surveillance than care.
