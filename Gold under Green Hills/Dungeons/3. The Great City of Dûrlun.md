## 7.1 Raphael's Infernal Propisition

- **Location:** Deep in the Halls of Echoing Lore, as the players search among the charred tomes and whispering scrolls, the oppressive heat around them suddenly intensifies. Shadows lengthen unnaturally, and the whispers coalesce into a melodic hum. The air becomes charged with a devilish energy.

- **Atmosphere**: The smell of sulfur and burnt parchment mingles as a sharp gust extinguishes all light sources. When the darkness lifts, Raphael, the charming devil in crimson, lounges on the edge of a toppled lectern, his lute resting lazily in one hand.

Raphael greets the party with his signature mix of charm and menace:

- **Raphael’s Greeting**:
	
    - "Well, well, well, what do we have here? Brave souls wandering where even the stones weep for mercy. How delightfully reckless. But enough about your questionable decisions—let’s talk about your… potential."
    
- He strums his lute, and a faint ripple of flame flickers across its strings, casting a warm, almost hypnotic glow. The party now appears in a gothic room with a singular chair in the center

- "I’ve been watching your little escapade. Quite the show, really. The way you handled those goblins—chef’s kiss. But I digress. I’ve come to offer a deal. You see, you’re not the only ones interested in the secrets of Dûrlun. And wouldn’t it be easier with a bit of infernal assistance?"

Raphael claims to know the **true purpose** of the forge and the **origin of the Fallen Guardian**. He offers information, assistance, or a powerful artifact in exchange for a favor:

1. **The Favor**: Raphael wants the party to retrieve an ancient infernal artifact hidden in the Vault of Dûrlun—a **Hellbound Seal**. It once bound a powerful fiend to the will of dwarven mages and could prove valuable to his interests.

2. **The Bargain**:
	- He offers a choice of rewards:
	
        - **Infernal Knowledge**: Insights into the tragic fall of Dûrlun, including weaknesses of the Guardian.
        
        - **Infernal Boon**: A **Devil’s Coin**, allowing the party to call Raphael for aid once in the future.
    
- **To the Reluctant**: "Oh, come now. What’s a little favor among friends? Or would you rather face the Guardian blind, deaf, and clueless? Your choice."

- **To the Greedy**: "Imagine the power at your fingertips. The respect, the fear. One little trinket, and all that could be yours."

- **To the Heroic**: "Oh, you noble fools. Let me guess—you’d rather struggle valiantly and die with your oh-so-precious morals intact? Such a waste of potential."

**If the Party Accepts**:

- Raphael provides a cryptic clue about the Guardian: “Look for the light that binds—it may save your necks when molten fury falls.”

- He vanishes in a swirl of smoke, leaving the room smelling faintly of brimstone.

- The Hellbound Seal will be found in the Vault of Dûrlun, guarded by infernal constructs.

- If returned to Raphael, he keeps his word and rewards the party, though they will owe him a future favor.

**If the Party Refuses**:
    
- Raphael sneers: "Very well. Struggle, stumble, and fall—I’ll be watching. And when you’re begging for mercy, remember this moment."

- He vanishes, leaving behind a lingering sense of dread and the faint echo of mocking laughter.

**If the Party Attacks**:
    
- Raphael toys with the party, deflecting attacks with ease. After taking minimal damage, he grows bored and teleports away, leaving a parting quip:

- "Fiery tempers—how fitting. Until next time, my brave fools."

- **Encounter - [[Goblin Ashlord Profile]] & Burned Goblins**: The **Goblin Ashlord** leads a band of burned goblins, scavenging among the remains, if they notice the party they will yell over "You lying bastards, the gold, where's the gold.".

```

## 9. Dragon's Rest - The Fallen Dragon

- **Description**: As the players move deeper into the depths of Dûrlun, they enter a grand, dimly lit hall with a large,  rune-covered vault door. Within, they find the massive, still form of a dragon sprawled across the floor, its immense scales darkened, cracked, and dull from age and fire. Its wings are folded tightly against its body, and its head lies on the ground, eyes closed. It appears as though the dragon is merely resting, and the air feels charged with a lingering heat.
    
- **Initial Perception**: The sight of the dragon fills the room with an overwhelming presence. The party might initially think it’s sleeping, as a faint smoky haze still seems to drift from the creature’s nostrils. However, a successful **Perception check (DC 14)** or **Investigation check (DC 12)** reveals that the dragon is not asleep but has been dead for some time. Scorch marks and dried blood around its body hint at a fierce battle long past.
    
- **Clues and Exploration**:
    
    - **Scattered Remnants**: The area around the dragon has remnants of past conflicts. Burnt armor, broken weapons, and dwarven artifacts are scattered around, suggesting that this dragon was defeated by the dwarves of Dûrlun during the city's final days.

- **Description**: The players reach a room with:

	- A massive rune-covered vault door at one end
	- A few goblins littered around the top of the room.
	- And in the center there's a mound of dwarvern metal and molten rock, as they approach the mound of metal begins to rise and become something else the **[[Fallen Guardian]]** awakens—a towering, ancient dwarven automaton corrupted by fire with Green light emitting from within.
