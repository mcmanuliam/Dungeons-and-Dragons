- **Description**: Blister Wraiths are the spectral remnants of dwarven smiths who perished in flames. Their incorporeal forms shimmer with flickering orange and blue fire, and their haunting whispers echo with fragments of dwarven chants. While tragic figures, they are consumed by malice, lashing out at the living with their fiery touch.

- **Abilities**:
    - **Scorching Touch.** Melee Spell Attack:
    - +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    - _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) fire damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be ignited, taking 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of their next turn until they or another creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.
    
- **Ghostly Wail** (1/Day):
    - The Blister Wraith releases a soul-piercing wail. Each creature within a 30 ft. radius that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

- **Incorporeal Movement**:
    - The Wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage.
    
- **Possession** (1/Day):
	- The Blister Wraith attempts to possess a humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a **DC 10 Intelligence saving throw** or be possessed by the Wraith. While possessed, the Wraith disappears into the target's body, and the target is under the Wraith's control.
		
	    - On every turn after possession the player must role a **DC 10 Intelligence** throw
    
- **Tactics**: Blister Wraiths avoid direct confrontation and instead use their **Ghostly Wail** to scatter the players, then attack isolated targets. Theyâ€™re drawn to non-dwarves in the party and focus on characters who appear unarmored or weak.
