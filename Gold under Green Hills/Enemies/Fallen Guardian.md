- **Description**: A towering behemoth of molten rock and jagged metal, the Fallen Guardian is a living relic of a forgotten age. With green flame coursing through its veins and a cannon fused to its left arm, it stands as an unyielding sentinel against any who dare trespass. It is powered by volatile core nodes—the pressure points—that, if destroyed, render the Guardian inert.

- **Abilities**:
    - **Green Flame Strike** (Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack):
	    - +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 40 ft., one target.
	    - _Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 4) fire damage. The target’s AC is reduced by 1 until the end of the Guardian’s next turn.
	
	- **Guardian’s Gaze** (Recharge 5–6):
	    - The Fallen Guardian emits an intimidating glare. Each creature within 30 feet of the Guardian that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
	    
	- **Inferno Overload** (Recharge 5–6):
	    - The Guardian unleashes a burst of molten fire in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
		
	- **Cannon Slam**:
        - The Guardian slams its cannon arm into the ground, targeting a creature within 10 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 12 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
        
    - **Molten Grapple**:
        - The Guardian attempts to grab a creature within 10 feet. On a successful melee attack (+7 to hit), the target is grappled (escape DC 14) and takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns while grappled. The Guardian cannot use its Green Flame Strike while grappling.

- **Tactics**:
    - The Fallen Guardian begins combat with **Guardian’s Gaze** to disorient intruders.
    
    - It focuses on high-armor characters with **Green Flame Strike**, reducing their defenses for its allies or its follow-up attacks.

    - When surrounded, it uses **Inferno Overload** to punish clustering players.

    - If heavily damaged, it attempts to defend its pressure points, using **Molten Grapple** to incapacitate attackers and **Cannon Slam** to disrupt groups.

- **Loot**: Ingots of adamantine bars, and potentially a damaged version of the Guardian’s cannon - https://dnd-5e.fandom.com/wiki/Pyroconverger.
