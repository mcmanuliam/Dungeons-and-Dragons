- **Description**: Although gnomes seem small and harmless they are masters of ambush and stealth, they blend seamlessly into their natural surroundings, becoming nearly invisible among the foliage. Though cautious and distrustful of outsiders, they fiercely defend their homes with traps and coordinated strikes, using their agility and cunning to great effect.

**Abilities**:

- **Dagger Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack:
    - +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    - _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. Woodland Stalkers can attack twice with their dagger and immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
    
- **Natural Camouflage:**
    - In forest or woodland environments, the gnome has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can hide when only lightly obscured by foliage or shadows.
    
- **Sneak Attack** (1/Turn):
    - The gnome deals an extra 3 (1d6) damage when it hits a creature with a melee weapon attack if it has advantage on the attack roll, or if an ally is within 5 feet of the target and isnâ€™t incapacitated.

- **Gnome Toss**:
	- Two Gnomes coordinate to launch one of their own at a target within 30 feet. The thrown gnome makes a melee attack against the target with advantage, dealing 7 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the attack misses, the thrown gnome lands prone within 5 feet of the target.

- **Back Jumper**:
	- The gnome jumps onto a creature within 5 feet that is at least one size larger than itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or the gnome latches onto its back, grappling it (escape DC 12). While grappled, the target's movement is halved, and the gnome can make a dagger attack as a bonus action each turn.

	- **During the players turn the Gnome get's an attack**

- **Fey Resistance:**
    - The Woodland Stalker has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
