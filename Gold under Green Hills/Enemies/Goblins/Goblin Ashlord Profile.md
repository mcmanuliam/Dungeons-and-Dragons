- **Description**: Goblin Ashlords are pyromaniacal leaders of goblin tribes who harness fire magic to terrorize their enemies. They are often found surrounded by ash-strewn battlefields, their blazing powers as dangerous to their foes as to their own allies.

- - **Abilities**:
    - **Fire Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack:
        - +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
        - _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) fire damage.
    
    - **Ash Cloud** (1/Day):
        - The Ashlord conjures a 10 ft. radius cloud of ash centered on itself. Creatures within the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be blinded while inside the cloud. The cloud persists for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.
    
    - **Burning Hands** (Recharge 5â€“6):
        - The Ashlord exhales a 15 ft. cone of fire. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
- **Tactics**: The Ashlord stays at range, using **Fire Bolt** and **Ash Cloud** to maintain distance, while the goblins rush in melee.

- **Loot**: Burned trinkets and 1-2 fire-resistant potions.
