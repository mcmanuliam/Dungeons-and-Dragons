- **Description**: Magma Golems are towering constructs of molten rock and slag, animated by ancient dwarven magic. Their fiery cores glow through the cracks in their bodies, creating an imposing sight as they relentlessly pursue intruders. Slow but nearly unstoppable, their attacks leave searing wounds and spread molten rock wherever they tread.

- **Abilities**:
    - **Molten Rock Throw** (Ranged Weapon Attack):
        - +6 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target.
        - _Hit:_ 9 (2d8) fire damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
    
    - **Fiery Slam** (Melee Weapon Attack):
        - +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        - _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d6) fire damage. At the start of the targetâ€™s next turn, it takes an additional 4 (1d6) fire damage unless extinguished as an action.
    
    - **Lava Burst** (1/Day):
        - When the Magma Golem drops below half health, it releases a burst of molten rock in a 15 ft. radius. Each creature in range must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

---

- **Tactics**:
    - The Magma Golem begins combat by using **Molten Rock Throw** to weaken or knock down distant enemies.
    - It uses **Fiery Slam** to punish enemies at close range, leaving lingering fire damage on its targets.
    - When heavily damaged, it triggers **Lava Burst** to discourage close combat and buy time for additional attacks.
