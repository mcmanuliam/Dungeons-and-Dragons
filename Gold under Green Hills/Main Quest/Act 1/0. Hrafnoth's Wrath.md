You awake in a dimly lit prison cell on a sturdy iron ship, creaking and swaying as it cuts through rough waters. The air is damp and thick with the smell of salt and rusted metal. Chains clink in rhythm with the boat’s movement, and the occasional muffled shout or footsteps echo through the narrow corridors above.

You and your fellow prisoners are locked in cells surrounded by runes inscribed with protective wards and two guards sitting outside. It’s been days since your capture and now you’re being transported to a mysterious destination, likely to face judgment… or worse. 

1. **Introduction to the Ship Dungeon**
	- **Guard Interactions:** The guards, although wary, occasionally grumble about their orders. Some are disgruntled, muttering about how much trouble “another dragon transfer” has been, and how transporting a “wounded wyrm” feels like a disaster waiting to happen. 
	    
	- **Items to Find:** A rusty nail, a sharp-edged stone, or even a discarded pin—all useful items that might help players pick locks or break free.

2. **Rumors and Whispers**
	As the ship rocks, you overhear a faint, heated conversation through the walls between two guards. One of them sounds panicked:
	
> 	“Are you mad? Transporting _him_? You saw what he did to the last crew who tried to contain him.”
> 	
> 	“Orders are orders. Just get him to the Council they'll handle the rest, no idea how they will get it up to Durlun." 
> 	


 3. **Escape Sequence: The Attack Begins**
	Suddenly, a deep, thunderous roar pierces the air. The ship trembles as if struck by a massive force, and the crackling sound of flames follows, mixed with the terrified screams of sailors. In moments, chaos erupts, and the deck above shakes under the weight of a colossal presence. The guards watching over run out in a panic.
	
	Through the narrow gaps in your cell doors, you glimpse a shadow darkening the ship’s interior as a massive claw shreds the deck above. Smoke and fire begin to fill the cell.

	**Escape Mechanics**
	
	- **Lockpicking & Strength Checks:** Players can attempt to pick the locks on their cells (DC 14 Dexterity check) using makeshift items they’ve found. Alternatively, a DC 18 Strength check will let players try to break free by force. Success lets them out into the lower deck, where they face more obstacles in their bid for freedom.
	    
	- **Fires & Falling Debris:** As the dragon's assault intensifies, flames spread, and sections of the ceiling crack, sending debris down onto the players. Players must make Dexterity saving throws (DC 7) to avoid falling debris.

	As the players exit the cell you can see stairs to the left and a door to your right, **on stairs continue to next step**, on right there's a room which looks like guard quarters

	- **Guard Quarters** 
		- **Weapon Rack**: There's an empty weapon rack with only a flare gun on it.
		
	- **Desk**: A small writing desk in the corner has a drawer slightly open, revealing scraps of paper:
		- **An old map** of the nearby seas, with an “X” marked near the **Lost Peaks**

4. **Confrontation with Hrafnoth’s Fear Aura**
	As you make your way to the upper deck, you catch your first glimpse of a dragon, in the midst of his rage. His sheer size dwarfs the ship, and his obsidian-black scales glint ominously in the firelight. As his gaze sweeps the deck, players must resist the overwhelming aura of fear (DC 15 Wisdom save). Failing the save means player are overwhelmed, they know who they stand infront of, this is Hrafnoth, the Raven-Wyrm. their movements sluggish (-3 on Dex and Acrobatics).
	
	The dragon's assault shatters the ship’s main deck, splitting it apart as a surge of seawater floods the hold. The dragon’s fire ignites sections of the boat, and the entire structure begins to sink. This creates an intense, time-pressured escape sequence where players must dodge flames, broken beams, and flooding water.

	 Give a player the option of picking up a shinny ingot, they must roll Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 7.

- **Final Obstacle - The Lifeboats:** A few small lifeboats remain unscathed on the far side of the deck, partially shielded from the dragon’s fiery wrath. Players must make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks (DC 7) to dodge flames and get to the boats before the entire vessel sinks.


 5. **Climactic Shipwreck**
	As the lifeboats are lowered into the water, you hear Hrafnoth’s powerful roar once more before he finally leaves into the mountains, content to let the ship burn and sink. The remaining lifeboats drift away from the wreckage, scattering your group to unknown shores.

After hours adrift on the open sea, you finally find solid ground, washed ashore at the edge of the **Silverleaf Woods**. The night air is chilly, and the faint sounds of distant wildlife are both comforting and unsettling. You’re exhausted, soaked, and in need of warmth and rest.

As you gather your bearings, a flickering light catches your eye through the trees in the distance. It’s faint, but unmistakable, suggesting shelter or, at the very least, the presence of other people nearby. The decision is now yours: do you follow the light, hoping it leads to refuge, or do you set up camp here by the shore and rest under the open sky?

##### Option 1: Follow the Light
If the players choose to follow the light, they make their way through the dense, shadowed trees of the Silverleaf Woods. The ground is damp and soft underfoot, and every now and then, a quiet rustling from unseen creatures in the underbrush adds to the sense of eerie calm.

After a short but tense walk, the light leads them to a small village nestled among the trees: **Mirthvale**. The village’s soft glow spills out from its quaint, rounded homes and warm lanterns line the cobblestone streets, welcoming but oddly still.

As the players enter the village it's empty looks like everyone's asleep, there's a few things around you:

- Tavern (Closed)
- Mirthvale Town Hall (Closed)
- Greggorys Bakery (Closed)
- Mirthy Merchants (Closed)
- Mirth Inn (Open)
- Village Watch (Closed)

- **Mirth Inn**
	As the players settle in, Lady Tova makes an appearance, entering the inn with a slow, measured pace. She glances at each player with an unsettlingly intense gaze, her piercing blue eyes holding a keen, almost predatory interest. Her lips curl into a polite but unsettling smile as she introduces herself, extending a thin, delicate hand.

> 	**Lady Tova**: “Welcome to Mirthvale, travelers. Not often we see new faces these days… you must have had quite the journey to end up here.” She pauses, her gaze unwavering, “We’re a peaceful folk here, you see. We value… respect and discretion.”

- **Innkeeper Dialogue Options**:

- If asked about Mirthvale’s history or about the strange quiet in the village, Bertram’s voice drops even lower, as he responds:
    
    > **Bertram**: “Peaceful folk, like Lady Tova says. Not much to tell… we don’t meddle in others’ business here. It’s… safer that way.”
    
- When the players ask about a room or food, Bertram gives a faint nod, serving them without complaint but with an unsettling silence:
    
    > **Bertram**: “Rooms upstairs. Two silver each. Don’t mind the quiet… we prefer it that way.”
    
- If players inquire about Lady Tova, his response is respectful yet wary:
    
    > **Bertram**: “She’s… wise. Knows what’s best for us all, and keeps us safe. Don’t be asking too many questions.”
    

**Lady Tova Dialogue Options**:

- If players inquire about the unusual flowers or the mysterious gnomes, she smiles cryptically:
    
    > **Lady Tova**: “The forest holds many secrets, dear ones. But not all secrets are meant to be uncovered. Curious folk often find themselves… entangled in things they do not understand.”
    
- Should players hint at their encounter with Hrafnoth or any supernatural experiences:
    
    > **Lady Tova**: “Dragons? Ah, myths, I’m sure… but be careful with such tales. They carry weight here in Mirthvale.”
    
##### Option 2: Set Up Camp on the Shore
If the players decide to stay by the shore, they gather driftwood and other supplies to set up a small camp. The sounds of the crashing waves and the gentle rustling of the trees create an almost calming atmosphere. A faint fog begins to settle over the shoreline, adding a ghostly quality to the night.

- **Campfire and Rest**: The players set up a campfire, warming themselves and drying their soaked clothes. This short rest allows them to regain some health or expendable resources. It’s also a moment of relative calm after the dragon attack.
    
- **A Subtle Presence**: During the night, if anyone is on watch, they might catch glimpses of small, shadowy figures at the edge of the woods. With a Perception check (DC 8), they can hear faint whispers or laughter—almost childlike yet unsettling.

> “Do you think they’re the ones?”  
> “Shh! We don’t want them to see us… yet.”

The figures disappear as quickly as they’re spotted, leaving the party with a vague sense of unease. In the morning, they find small, intricately woven flowers left near the edges of their camp—a signature sign of the gnomes from Mirthvale.
