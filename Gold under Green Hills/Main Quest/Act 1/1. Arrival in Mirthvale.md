The party arrives in **[[Mirthvale]]**, a village nestled in the serene **Silverleaf Woods**. It’s clear that Mirthvale is a peaceful place, with everything arranged in perfect harmony. The cobblestone streets wind between quaint, rounded homes, and the gardens burst with vibrant flowers. However, beneath the beauty, something feels off. The villagers' smiles linger a bit too long, and their polite conversations are unnervingly cordial.

As the players step out of the **Mirth Inn** for the first time, a gnome in a green uniform leans casually against a nearby lamppost, watching them with a friendly but unsettling smile. **[[Captain Mimsy]]** pushes off the post and approaches, tipping his hat in greeting.

> **Captain Mimsey**: “Ah, newcomers, Welcome to Mirthvale. I’m Captain Mimsey, head of the village watch.”

He gestures around with a flourish, his tone light yet oddly probing.

> **Captain Mimsey**: “Strange times, aren’t they? With folk going missing. You look like capable sorts—perhaps you’d be interested in a little… opportunity?”

Mimsey leans in slightly, his voice softening.

> **Captain Mimsey**: “There’s been… rumors. About Durlun, the city to the north. It’s said they’ve been sending spies, stirring up trouble in our lovely Mirthvale. And then there’s the disappearances—well, there's suspicions it’s all connected, I’m sure The Council would be… most grateful, probably a bit of coin in it for you too.”

With a last, lingering look, Mimsey tips his hat again, his smile too knowing.

> **Captain Mimsey**: “Ah perfect just follow that path over there, enjoy your stay in Mirthvale, friends and don't cause too much of a ruckus while you're here.

- **Exploration**:
    - The players can explore Mirthvale, interacting with various gnomes. Most conversations are superficial, with the gnomes maintaining an eerie politeness. A few of the gnomes are _a bit_ unsettling: one may laugh for too long at a simple comment, another may glance at the party with a coldness that doesn’t quite match their words.
    
    - **Notice Board**:  
        On the notice board, the players find numerous _missing persons_ posters, some dating back years. The names and faces of the missing are all strangers, but the sheer volume of disappearances should catch the players' attention. 
        
        The posters are well-maintained, but there’s an air of resignation about them, almost as if no one really expects to find the missing.

	- **[[Lady Tova, Village Elder of Mirthvale]]**
		**Location**: Near the center of the village, in front of the **Mirthvale Town Hall**.
		
		Lady Tova is an elderly gnome who is known to be the village’s unofficial "matriarch." She’s always seen wearing a long, finely woven cloak and an intricate brooch shaped like a flower, with piercing eyes that seem to take in everything and everyone around her.
		
	    As the players approach, she smiles at them with an unnerving warmth, her eyes lingering a little too long. "Welcome, travelers," she says, her voice smooth and polite. "Mirthvale has always been a sanctuary of peace. I'm sure you'll find everything just to your liking."
		
	    If the players ask about the missing people, she simply nods, still smiling, but her tone hardens just a touch. "Oh, yes, many people come and go in Mirthvale. Some... never stay long, of course. But we have nothing to hide here."
		
	    If pushed, she chuckles softly and adds, "You must forgive me. I’m sure you have your own journey to think about. Let’s not dwell on such unpleasant topics."
		
	- **[[Fenwick, The Village Merchant]]**
		**Location**: Outside a small, well-kept shop selling various goods, including herbs, potions, and trinkets.
	
		Fenwick is a middle-aged gnome with a mop of silver hair and a nervous twitch in his eye. He’s always seen fidgeting with small items—coins, keys, or bits of thread—as if his hands never know what to do.
		
		Fenwick is happy to talk to the players, but his words are often scattered. "Ah, new faces! Always a pleasure to see travelers—such _joy_ in the world, don’t you think? I sell the finest goods here, I do! Of course, you should take a look around."
		
		When the conversation turns to the missing persons, Fenwick’s eyes shift nervously. He takes a quick look around to make sure no one is listening. "Many come to Mirthvale, but... some leave, and... well, sometimes they just don’t come back. The town doesn’t speak of it much." He laughs awkwardly, but his smile falters. "I’m sure it’s nothing, just... accidents, right? Yes, yes, accidents. You’ll be fine."
		
		If the players try to press him, Fenwick gets jittery and changes the subject. "Have you seen the new flowers in the garden? Absolutely spectacular, they are—especially the lavender."
		
		When asked about stock he lists off the following: [[]]
		
	- **Tavern: The Lost Lantern**
		**Location**: Near the edge of the village, just before the winding trail leads deeper into the Silverleaf Woods.
		
		Inside, the tavern is cozy, the low ceiling decorated with hanging herbs and colorful flowers. A large fireplace crackles in one corner, casting a flickering glow that dances across the room. The smell of fresh-baked bread and savory stews fills the air. The wooden tables are well-worn, but polished, with intricately carved patterns of vines and leaves. Several patrons are gathered around, nursing ales or sipping on warm cider. The drinks seem strong, though not many are overly rowdy.
		
		As you enter there's no bar tender in sight but there's a group of gnomes having a conversation in the corner.
		
		> "Did you hear? Old Berrin said he saw the sky darken over Dûrlun, right over the Graypeak Mountains... like a shadow was looming, big as the sun itself. And then... a _huge_ shadow, like a dragon's wings! Said he heard it, too, the distant roar of a beast."
		
		>"Ah, Glimmer, you're getting old! Dragons don't just fly around like that anymore. You’re sure it wasn’t just the clouds? Maybe a big bird or somethin’?"
		
		>"No, no! It was no bird. Berrin swears it was _Hrafnoth_. The beast from the west... the one the dwarves of Dûrlun can’t stop talkin’ about. They say it comes for their gold."
		
		>"I heard rumors too. My cousin’s cousin said they’ve got these incredible weapons, like the [[Flammskrýfa]], a belt that when you wear it allows you to walk through fire, a lot of these weapons are long gone but the belt I'm not sure, legends say they’ve lost it, or someone’s hiding it... but it’s the only thing that can stop the beast, if it comes back.

		At some point during this section a fan will run over to Cal and ask for an autograph.

There’s not much incentive to stay in Mirthvale
