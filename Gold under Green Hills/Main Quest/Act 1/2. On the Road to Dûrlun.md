After leaving **[[Mirthvale]]**, the party will continue their journey toward **[[The Great City of Dûrlun]]**. Along the way, they will encounter a few unsettling events that highlight the dangers of the world and subtly foreshadow what lies ahead.

- **Exploration**:
	- **Gnome Problems**
		**Location**: The players find themselves on a narrow trail leading through the **Silverleaf Woods**. The forest is dense, and the sunlight barely filters through the thick canopy above. The path is quiet, with only the sounds of the wind rustling the leaves. However, the peaceful atmosphere is abruptly broken as the party notices a small **group of gnomes** ahead, standing in their way.
		
		The gnomes are dressed in dark, torn clothing, much different from the flowery, soft colors typically worn in **Mirthvale**. Their faces are stern, and their eyes narrow as the party approaches. They are not the familiar, overly polite villagers, but rather a group of gnomes. Their demeanor is **hostile**, and their stances suggest they’re ready to attack.
		
		**Dialogue**: As the party approaches, the leader of the gnomes, a **tall** and **intimidating gnome**, steps forward. He speaks with a **sharp tone**, clearly not interested in polite conversation. His voice is laced with suspicion and disdain.

		- **Leader’s Dialogue**:  
		    "You come from **Mirthvale**, don't you?" He looks the party up and down, his eyes cold. "We’ve seen enough of your kind in that cursed place. Don’t think we’ll let you pass so easily."
		    
		    - If the party tries to explain their intentions or deny their connection to Mirthvale, he interrupts sharply. "Words don’t matter. We know your scent. You’ve come for **the treasure**, haven’t you? You and the rest of them. Mirthvale sends its rats out into the world to take what doesn’t belong to them."
		    
		    - If the players attempt to engage with reason, he sneers. "Peaceful little Mirthvale, eh? Don’t fool yourselves. You think those smiles are real? There’s nothing peaceful about them, and there’s nothing left for you here."
		
		The players always have to go through combat, the 4 gnomes run at you with daggers in hand.
	
	- **The Mysterious Traveler**
		**Location:** As the party walks down the road toward Dûrlun, they come across a **cloaked figure** with a cart standing at the edge of the woods. The figure’s face is hidden beneath the hood, but their eyes gleam with an unnerving brightness.
	
		The traveler speaks with a cryptic tone: "I see you’ve come from Mirthvale. Be careful on your journey. You don't know what's ahead" They give the party an unsettling smile, one that stretches too far. "Make sure you treat each other like it's your last day on this earth.
	
		He then snaps back "Anyway, take a look at what I've got", he gestures towards his cart, feel free to take a look.
