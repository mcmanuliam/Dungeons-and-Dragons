The party is greeted with unnerving enthusiasm as they re-enter the village. Banners wave, villagers bustle about in excitement, and cheerful music fills the air. **Lady Tova**, **Captain Mimsey**, **Bertram**, and **Fenwick** warmly invite the party to stay and partake in the festival, even offering them a place of honor during the main feast.

> **Lady Tova**: “Ah, our heroes return just in time! You must join us for the Festival of Flourish—an age-old tradition of Mirthvale. A time to honor our blessings and… ensure the continued prosperity of our little haven.”

The Council’s tone is overly sweet, their gazes lingering too long, and their politeness feels suffocating. An **Insight check (DC 14)** reveals underlying tension in their words, as though they’re desperate to keep the players in the village for some reason.

The party is paraded around as guests of honor, but observant characters may notice strange details:

- **Whispers from the Villagers**: Snippets of hushed conversations can be overheard with a **Perception check (DC 13)**:
    
    > “It’s them, isn’t it? The ones they’ve been waiting for?” “Do you think it’ll be different this time? It never is.” “I just hope it’s quick…”
    
- **Creeping Magic**: A faint magical aura blankets the village, intensifying near the festival grounds. A **Detect Magic** spell reveals overlapping schools of illusion, enchantment, and necromancy.

At the festival’s climax, the Council hosts a grand feast in the players’ honor. The food is exquisite, particularly the sausage rolls, pies, and pastries—Colin’s signature dishes. The Council watches intently as the party eats, subtly urging them to indulge.

- **Arcane Influence**: The food is enchanted. Any character who consumes it must make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 15)** or fall under the effects of a _Suggestion_ spell, making them more inclined to trust the Council and ignore strange occurrences.
    
- **Suspicious Absences**: The villagers are oddly quiet about Colin’s absence. Stating he must've left early for Water Deep, but a **Persuasion (DC 14)** or **Insight (DC 12)** check reveals their discomfort.
