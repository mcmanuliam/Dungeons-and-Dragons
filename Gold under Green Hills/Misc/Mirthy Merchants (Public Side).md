### General Items

**1. Rusty Bag of Curiosities** **[ON SALE NOW FREE]**

- A patched, faded bag with suspicious stains and a faint smell of something… indescribable.
- The merchant claims it’s great for “holding all your junk.” 
- You feel weirdly drawn to this bag.

**2. Gnome-Crafted Trinkets** _(2 sp each)_

- Miniature wind-up toys shaped like beetles and birds.
- A carved wooden puzzle box that’s annoyingly difficult to open.

**3. Tinkerer’s Tools (Slightly Used)** _(4 gp)_

- Comes with a free “totally real” warranty. The merchant promises, “It’ll probably work!”

**4. Wacky Whetstones** _(3 sp)_

- Gnome-made sharpening stones with colorful swirls. Adds a small chance of making your weapon spark during combat (purely cosmetic).

**5. Mismatched Socks of Warmth** _(10 sp per pair)_

- Keeps your feet warm, no matter the weather. Comes in garish, clashing patterns.

### Potion Selection

**6. Fizzing Potion of Minor Healing** _(2 gp)_

- Heals 1d4+2 HP. The bottle bubbles and makes a fun _pop_ sound when opened.

**7. Glow Goo** _(10 sp)_

- A gooey yellow substance that provides dim light in a 10-foot radius for an hour. Non-toxic, but tastes awful (don’t ask).

**8. Potion of Gnome-Growth (Experimental)** _(1 gp)_

- For one hour, you grow 4 foot taller and gain an awkward bonus to Intimidation checks. Merchant warns, "Side effects include sudden bouts of giggling."

### Mystical and Magical Items

**9. Bejeweled Rat Cage** _(5 gp)_

- A golden cage with embedded fake gems. Contains a single very angry rat (non-magical). The merchant insists it’s cursed.

**10. Tinkling Bell of Alarm** _(3 gp)_

- Rings softly when touched. Has a 50% chance of loudly shrieking instead.

**11. Pebble of Endless Bounce** _(2 gp)_

- A smooth stone that bounces indefinitely when thrown. Comes with a disclaimer about potential property damage.

**12. Gnomish Spyglass** _(10 gp)_

- Works as a normal spyglass but adds glitter to whatever you’re looking at.
