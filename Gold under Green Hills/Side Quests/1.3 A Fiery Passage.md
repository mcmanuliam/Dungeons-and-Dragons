## A Dying Dwarf: A Clue to the Past
As the players continue deeper into the city, they come upon a **chamber** with a **dying dwarf**. His legs have been **burned to the bone**, leaving only **charred stumps**. His body sprawled across the floor as he weakly **scratches at the stone**, as if trying to tear apart the stones.

- **Dialogue**:
    - The dwarf’s voice is barely a whisper, but as the players approach, he rasps, "_Please... the burring... make it stop..._" His eyes are wide with **pain**, and his hand trembles as he gestures weakly toward a **wall** near him. "*Please*" The dwarf fades, his breath shallow. He dies before offering more information.
## A Fiery Passage
The players are left with the dwarf’s final cryptic message: the **wall** he pointed to seems **ordinary** at first glance, but upon closer inspection, they notice **runic carvings** and a faint, **glowing seam**. The runes pulse with a faint **heat**. The wall itself seems to radiate an unnatural warmth.

**The Clue**
- If they can read Dwarvish the runes read:

```
The fire burns... it does not consume. Only one who can bare the flames shall pass. Let the flames be your guide..
```

- If they investigate the area, they find the remains of a **burned journal** near the dwarf's body. The journal's final entry reads:
    
    "_The fire burns... it does not consume. Someone must bare the flames._"

The journal is burnt beyond further reading, but there's a drawing that makes it clear one of you must die in fire.

## On Failure
If anyone in the party tries to get around the enchantment they will take 1d6 of damage in fire.

## On Success
Once you break down the wall you are presented with a set of stairs leading up to a pedestal, on that pedestal you find a belt, as you reach out and grasp the belt, a surge of visions overwhelms your senses. The world around you seems to fade as you are transported through time. You see the legendary forges of Dûrlun, the flames roaring high as dwarven artisans work tirelessly, their faces set in determination. You witness the making of a legendary artifact, the crafting of its enchanted steel thread, the fire silk spun from ancient fire drakes, and the legendary smiths whose hands shaped it.

Then, in a final, intense flash, the knowledge floods into your mind—this is the **[[Flammskrýfa]]**, the ancient belt of the greatest artisans of Dûrlun. It grants its wearer immunity to fire, the strength to walk through molten metal without harm, and the power to withstand the most brutal conditions of warfare. With this belt, you are no longer just a traveler—you are the bearer of a lost legend, the very essence of dwarven craftsmanship woven into this relic.

As the visions subside, the weight of the **[[Flammskrýfa]]** in your hands feels different now, heavier with knowledge and power. The warmth it exudes is comforting yet intense, like the heart of a forge, burning with ancient strength.
