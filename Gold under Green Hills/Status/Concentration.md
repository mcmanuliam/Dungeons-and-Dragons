The most common way to have your concentration broken is via taking damage. When you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw for each source of damage, or your concentration is broken. The DC of this saving throw is either half the damage taken or 10, whichever is higher. A quick tip to help you remember: The DC is 10 unless the damage taken is at least 22, because we round down.

A character encountering environmental phenomena may, at the discretion of the DM, be asked to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, breaking concentration on a failure. The example given in the basic rules is getting hit by a wave while aboard a storm-tossed ship. Other examples might be a big earthquake, or falling trees in the midst of a windstorm.

While the above situations allow a character the chance to maintain their focus, some situations break a character’s concentration immediately, without a save:

- **Casting a second concentration spell.** Because you can only concentrate on one spell or ability at a time, a second source of concentration ends the first one.
- **Ending your concentration.** A character may end their concentration voluntarily, without using an action or a reaction.
- **Going into a rage.** Barbarians cannot concentrate while [raging](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#Rage-51).
- **Becoming incapacitated.** A character who becomes [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) loses concentration. 
- **Dying.** I trust this needs no explanation, but you can’t concentrate on an effect if you’re dead.

In all instances where a character’s concentration is broken, regardless of the situation or the method in which it happens, the active effect drops immediately—no fuss or room for shenanigans. This means, for example, when you begin concentrating on a second spell, you do not resolve the first spell’s effects one last time.

> **Rules Tip:** Remember that the following conditions apply the incapacitated condition, so they will also break concentration: [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition), [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition), and [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition). Additionally, because sleeping renders a character unconscious, it also breaks concentration.
