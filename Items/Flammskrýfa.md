**Legends speak of an item once worn by the greatest artisans of Dûrlun**, a city renowned for its mastery of the forge and its indomitable dwarven craftsmanship. The **Flammskrýfa** was said to be crafted with **enchanted dwarven steel thread** and lined with flame-resistant fabric spun from the magical fire silk of ancient fire drakes. It was believed to grant its wearer the unique ability to endure even the most extreme heat, to walk through the roaring flames of a forge without feeling pain or harm. Those who wore this legendary girdle were known to be able to work in the heart of molten metal and survive the most brutal conditions of warfare, fighting through the chaos of flames with unshakable resolve.

## Appearance
The **Flammskrýfa** is a finely crafted belt, its base made of **deep crimson leather**, scarred and etched with runes of fire and strength. The **steel thread** woven through the leather shimmers faintly, almost as if it too were alive with the pulse of flame. The belt's edges are lined with intricate **runes** and **dwarven symbols** that glow with an amber light, and in the center of the buckle is an engraved depiction of a **hammer striking an anvil**, surrounded by **fire**. It feels warm to the touch, yet it does not burn the skin, only providing a sense of comforting heat—like the heart of a forge.

### Lore and History
The **Flammskrýfa** was crafted by the legendary smiths of **Dûrlun**, a city of unparalleled dwarven artisans. It was said to be a symbol of their unmatched ability to work with the **furnaces and forges** of the world’s greatest fires. It was not only a tool but a symbol of the strength and durability of the dwarves themselves. Only the most trusted and skilled artisans were allowed to wear the **Flammskrýfa**, as it was believed that the fire it shielded against was not just elemental but also a test of character—a fire that could burn away weakness and forge strength in its wearer.

However, during a period of **war and turmoil**, the **Flammskrýfa** disappeared. Some say it was hidden away to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, while others believe it was stolen by a **treacherous fire mage** seeking to harness its power. Still, others claim that the belt was lost during the final days of **Dûrlun** before it was abandoned or destroyed. Whichever the truth, the **Flammskrýfa** remains a **mythical relic**—its location now a secret, its fate unknown. Some believe it still lies buried beneath the ruins of the city, awaiting the day when a worthy soul will find it and reclaim its power.
