## Appearance
The **Hammer of Hearthforge** is a beautifully crafted warhammer, a testament to dwarven artistry and durability. The handle is made from darkened, polished ironwood, wrapped with bands of sturdy leather that have survived countless battles. Along its length, **dwarven runes** are engraved, each symbolizing aspects of hearth, home, and unyielding strength. The head of the hammer is heavy and solid, a dark steel alloy with faint veins of red glowing within, as if embers are trapped just below the surface. When wielded, it emits a faint, comforting warmth.

The **face of the hammerhead** is engraved with an image of a roaring fire surrounded by the dwarven symbol for unity, and a soft red light pulses from the center. Every strike leaves behind a brief, shimmering ember trail in the air, symbolizing the warmth it brings to allies and the wrath it brings to foes.

### Lore and History
The **Hammer of Hearthforge** was crafted during a time of great unrest, when Dûrlun’s defenses were constantly tested by neighboring factions seeking to claim its resources. To empower their defenders, the legendary dwarven Forgemaster Thranor Flamebound created this hammer with the assistance of master enchanters, imbuing it with the essence of the **eternal hearthfire**. The Hammer of Hearthforge became a beacon for the dwarven soldiers, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the fire of their homeland would never go out.

During the fall of Dûrlun, the hammer was wielded by Captain Bofrim Stoneheart, who stood in defense of the great gates until his final breath. After his death, the hammer was lost, and legends say it was buried beneath the stones of Dûrlun, awaiting a new champion to awaken its flame.
