# Summary

## History & Origins

**Mirthvale** was founded by a tight-knit gnome community, renowned for their knack for creating intricate enchantments and their obsession with harmony and beauty. As word spread of its paradise-like charm, many travelers sought to visit, but few were ever welcomed in. Though gnomes elsewhere are known for their curiosity, those of **Mirthvale** prefer to keep their secrets close, viewing their perfection as something sacred and not meant for prying eyes. Over time, rumors began to spread, with some saying that the village’s “perfection” was maintained by ancient enchantments of a questionable nature, though these whispers remain unproven.

## Geography & Architecture

Tucked into the peaceful, mist-shrouded **Silverleaf Woods**, **Mirthvale** is hidden just out of sight from the major routes of the region, or at least it was, it lies on the road to [[The Great City of Dûrlun]] and since whispers of the cities incredible wealth spread across [[Faerûn]]. The village sits in a small, lush valley surrounded by dense woodlands, where wildflowers bloom year-round, and crystalline streams flow through stone-lined channels. 

Instead of grand halls and towering fortresses, **Mirthvale’s** charm lies in its diminutive, perfectly maintained cottages, each with rounded windows, thatched roofs, and garden beds bursting with vibrant flowers and ivy.

## Inhabitants & Culture

The gnomes of Mirthvale are incredibly kind, with a serene, almost unsettling politeness. Their village is a picture of perfect tranquility, and they go to great lengths to protect it. Outsiders are welcomed, but there's an air of quiet caution—smiles linger a bit too long, and conversations avoid certain topics. 

They’re fiercely protective of their peaceful way of life and will do anything to preserve their idyllic world, even if it means keeping secrets.

# Legends & Rumors
### The Vanishing of the Outsiders

One of the most whispered legends surrounding **Mirthvale** is the eerie disappearances that seem to plague those who venture too far into the village's tranquil depths. Outsiders, often adventurers or travelers drawn by curiosity, are said to visit the village only to vanish without a trace. 

The villagers’ unnervingly polite demeanor and their aversion to discussing these events raise suspicions that the disappearances may not be mere coincidence. Some claim the village is haunted by spirits aiming to keep the peace others believe that it's just an "accident".

## The Unbroken Silence

Some say that **Mirthvale**'s tranquility is not merely the result of its peaceful nature but is, in fact, the result of a long-forgotten pact made with dark forces. Whispers suggest that the village's eternal calm is not natural but enforced by ancient magic, a powerful silence that binds the minds and spirits of its residents. 

Those who speak of the pact are rarely heard from again, and the villagers will grow unusually cold if the topic arises. The village may remain unshaken for now, but some wonder if the cost of such peace is far greater than anyone realizes.
