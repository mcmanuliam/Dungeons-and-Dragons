 "Dûr" (dark or deep) and "lun" (meaning sanctuary), nestled deep within the towering **Lost Peaks**, the city of **Dûrlun** is a breathtaking marvel of dwarven wealth, a place where the very stone seems to glow with a golden radiance. Once a quiet refuge within the dark mountains, **Dûrlun** has been an unassailable stronghold of riches and power since before the founding of **Baldur's Gate**.

# Summary
## History & Origins

**Dûrlun** was once a hidden sanctuary for dwarves fleeing the wars and turmoil that ravaged the surface world. Established centuries ago by a clan of **master artisans** and **stoneworkers**, its once small settlement has grown into a mighty fortress-city built within the living stone. 

Over time, it became known for its unrivaled craftsmanship and the legendary wealth mined from the deep veins of gold, gemstones, and other precious metals that run throughout the mountains. Yet, its isolation also serves as protection, allowing it to prosper without interference.
## Geography & Architecture

The city is nestled deep within the towering **Graypeak Mountains**, where natural caverns and deep fissures in the stone have been transformed into vast subterranean halls. Some of these grand chambers so large that they can never be filled, with bridges of gleaming emerald stone spanning chasms and statues reaching down bellow where any normal persons vison goes. 

Ancient dwarven architecture dominates the landscape, with intricately carved spires and towering fortifications built from the stone itself.
## Inhabitants & Culture

The people of **Dûrlun** are dwarves—fiercely proud of their heritage, culture, and craftsmanship. Their lives are centered around honor, tradition, and the pursuit of wealth. While the dwarves of other lands may be known for their tolerance and trade with others, the dwarves of **Dûrlun** are far more insular. They view themselves as the rightful rulers of the mountains, and their mistrust of outsiders runs deep.

Elves, in particular, are loathed. Ancient conflicts between the elves and dwarves of **Dûrlun**—dating back to the War of the **Silverwood**—have fueled a bitter hatred that has passed down through generations. The dwarves believe elves are weak, too delicate, and far too enamored with the "soft" beauty of nature, while the dwarves take pride in their resilience and fortitude. Even dwarves from other regions may find themselves looked down upon if they seem too friendly with elves or other non-dwarven races.

# Legends & Rumors

## Hrafnoth Troubles

As **Dûrlun**'s wealth has spread far beyond the deep caverns of the **Graypeak Mountains** and into all of **[[Faerûn]]**, it has inevitably attracted the attention of those who covet such riches. It was rumored that **Hrafnoth**, the **dwarven** name given to the beast from "hrafn," meaning raven, and "noth," meaning one who rules, a wyrm from the western lands once descended upon the mountain, laying waste through fire and devastation to thousands of dwarves in an attempt to seize control of the mountain. 

The assault was ultimately stopped by **Duke Orin Grimborn**, but whispers speak that the dragon survived—and some even claiming it has been spotted in the skies once more, drawing closer and closer to the city’s ever-growing treasure hoard.

## The Power to withstand Fire

**Legends speak of an item** once worn by the greatest artisans of **Dûrlun**, said to be forged with enchanted dwarven steel thread and lined with flame-resistant fabric. It is believed to grant its wearer the ability to endure the most extreme heat and fire, allowing them to withstand the searing furnaces and molten metals of the forge without harm.

As time passed and the city of **Dûrlun** faced wars and turmoil, the item was lost to history, its whereabouts now a mystery whispered among the dwarves. Some say it was hidden away, others claim it was stolen, but no one knows for certain where it lies—or if it will ever be found again.
